Chrom extension that replaces the text "AI" in webpages with "thousands of workers in India".

This helpful text replacement will aid you in remembering that Artificial Intelligence, as it exists today, is based on the hard labors of many thousands of tireless categorizers, labelers, and scorers from the Indian peninsula. Indeed, perhaps the virtue of AI tools is that it acts as a sort of virtual, personal connection to thousands of workers in India striving to create brand new content, just for you.

## Installation

First, [download the crx file](https://github.com/sabslikesobs/ai-to-workers-in-india/blob/master/Extension.crx?raw=true). You may have to download the file from a different browser or from wget, as Chrome can refuse to download unsigned extensions.

Second, in Chrome, open Tools > Extensions. Drag Extension.crx into the page that appears.
